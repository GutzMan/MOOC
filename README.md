Open Source University Of Reading Android Game

This game is a breakout-style game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_clone). In which the player controls an object similar to a bat and attempts to hit a small ball towards a goal at the top of the screen to score points.

My main goals for this project were to... better understand object oriented programming, learn more about collision control in games and to introduce myself to tools that can be used for Android development (Android Studio.)
